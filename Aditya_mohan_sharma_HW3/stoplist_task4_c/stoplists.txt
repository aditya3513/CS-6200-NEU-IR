for the N=1, initial stop list is:
Threshold: 22
-----------------
the 244
of 143
carbon 116
and 107
to 96
a 75
emissions 61
footprint 60
for 60
in 57
is 45
by 37
or 35
as 33
are 26
from 25
can 25
be 23
co2 22
that 22

but since some of important words showed up like "carbon, emissions, footprint" due to their high frequency. We can remove them manually and use this stop list after manual reduction while we check for punctuations on words and remove words there ate kept.

for N=2, initial stop list:
threshold: 13
---------------------
carbon footprint 49
the carbon 26
of the 25
carbon dioxide 17
in the 17
of carbon 15
to the 13


This time it was hard to decide the threshold as with 2grams, the words are in together and there can be cases where a phrase is being repeated again like "carbon footprint, carbon dioxide" since its is the title. Secondly there are cases where "carbon" is being used a lot and in conjunction with other words which makes it appear in stop list, We can manually remove there words from stop list

##################################
for N=3, initial stop list:
threshold: Not found
---------------------
initial list in order of frequency looks like:

the carbon footprint 18
carbon footprint of 13
of carbon dioxide 8
the voluntary market 8
a carbon footprint 6
carbon footprint is 6
the kyoto protocol 5
cers and erus 5
in the voluntary 5
carbon dioxide equivalent 4
the amount of 4

Here frequency of terms reduces as we are clubbing values together and making phrases. It gets more difficult to create a stop list. if we choose a threshold like 8, it make phrases containing "carbon footprint" part of stop list which will give incorrect results.

EXPLANATION:
For choosing the Threshold we look at the term Freq table and check which words have really high frequency, since list if sorted in order Descending order of Freq. We can look at top of list to determine the stop list.

Its really important to choose correct Threshold as if its too low, we will have lost of stop words, if too high then too little stop words.
